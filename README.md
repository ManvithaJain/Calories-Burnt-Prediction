# Calories-Burnt-Prediction

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate calories burnt based on various features. The goal is to create an accurate model that can help in tracking and understanding calorie expenditure, which is useful for fitness applications and health tracking systems.

# Project Objectives
To analyze the dataset and explore key factors affecting calories burnt.
To preprocess data and perform feature engineering for model optimization.
To build and evaluate machine learning models to predict calorie expenditure.
To visualize the insights gained from the data and model results.

# Dataset
